# Huddersfield

The project covers Huddersfield, as well as the Huddersfield line between Stalybridge (Greater Manchester) and Dewsbury (West Yorkshire). Also included is the Standedge Railway Tunnel, built in 1894 and the fifth longest rail tunnel in the UK.

The services on this route are comprised of various TransPennine Express services between Manchester and Leeds, but included also are Northern services in and around Huddersfield, Mirfield, and Stalybridge, as well as Grand Central services through Mirfield.

## Simulation

The included timetable runs from 05:00 until 22:00. I have included several starting points (all using the same timetable) in the morning so you can decide where to start. I would recommend starting at 05:00 for the largest variety of services including freight.

I have not included any sessions, however there are a few automatic routes that you can set up, especially through the central area, that will help with opetration.
